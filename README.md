Healthcare uses technology which has advanced too fast, such that the elderly are unable to catch up and they are left behind. We aim to simplify such technology for the elderly to use. Also, we focus on UX as an attempt to slowly integrate the elderly into the world of technology, in a similar fashion as to how we as children learn through play and interaction.
